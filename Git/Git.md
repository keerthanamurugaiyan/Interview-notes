**1.**
    check git repo =>git remote -v
    remove repo => git remote remove origin
    add repo => git remote add origin URL


**2.  What is a conflict?**
         
        Git usually handles feature merges automatically but sometimes while working in a team environment, there might be cases of conflicts such as:

   **1.** When two separate branches have changes to the same line in a file
   **2.** A file is deleted in one branch but has been modified in the other.    


**3. difference between Git and GitHub?**

| **Git**                                                                 | **GitHub**                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Git is a distributed version control system installed on local machines. It allows developers to track changes in code, manage commit histories, and collaborate on code. | GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It provides a central repository where code can be stored, shared, and collaborated on using Git.             |
| It is maintained by "The Linux Foundation."                             | It was acquired by "Microsoft" in 2018.                                |
| Competitors include SVN, Mercurial, etc.                                | Competitors include GitLab, Atlassian Bitbucket, etc.                 |
| Focuses on version control and local repository management.             | Offers additional features like forking, user management, pull requests, and issue tracking, making collaboration easier.           |

In simple terms, **Git** is the underlying tool for managing versions of your code, while **GitHub** is a platform that makes it easier to share and work on Git repositories online.
