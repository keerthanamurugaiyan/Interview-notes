    check git repo =>git remote -v

**2.  What is a conflict?**
         
        Git usually handles feature merges automatically but sometimes while working in a team environment, there might be cases of conflicts such as:

   **1.** When two separate branches have changes to the same line in a file
   **2.** A file is deleted in one branch but has been modified in the other.
