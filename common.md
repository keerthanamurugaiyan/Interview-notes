**1.Difference between Static web pages and Dynamic web pages.**

**Ans:**

**I. Static web page:**
        The content of static web page is fixed and does not chance unless the page's HTML code is manually updated.

**(eg) :**  Portfolio

**II. Dynamic web page:**
    Dynamic web pages are generated in real-time based on user interactions. Database queries or other criteria , The content can change without altering the pages HTML code.

**(eg) :** Flipcart , You tube


**2.What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements? Can you provide examples?**

**Ans:**
    
   **(i)  Pseudo-classes:**  Apply styles to elements based on their state **(e.g., :hover for when an element is hovered over, :focus for when an element is focused).**
    
   **(i)  Pseudo-elements:**  Target specific parts of an element **(e.g., ::before to insert content before an element's content, ::after to insert content after).**


**3. What are the tools used for api testing?**
    
   **•** Soapui pro
   **•** Postman
   **•** Alertsite api monitoring   

**4. What is Api?**
    
   An API **(Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules that allows different software applications to communicate with each other, enabling them to request and exchange data. It's like a bridge that connects different systems, allowing them to work together.


**5. What is Toasts ?**

Key Characteristics of Toasts:

Non-intrusive:Toasts do not block the user interface and automatically disappear after a short time.

Customizable :You can style and position toasts as needed, including adding headers,body content, and different visual styles.

Auto-dismissal: They can be set to disappear automatically after a set time or can be dismissed by the user.

 **Example:** success and error. 


**6. Explain the difference between React and Angular?**
 
   **React.js:-**
      **•**	React.js is a JavaScript library. As it indicates react js updates only the virtual DOM is present and the data flow is always in a single direction.
      **•**	React.js is more simplified as it follows MVC ie., Model View Control.
      **•**	It is highly scalable.
      **•**	It supports Uni-directional data binding which is one-way data binding.
      **•**	It has a virtual DOM.     

   **Angular:-**   
      **•**	Angular is a framework. Angular updates the Real DOM and the data flow is ensured in the architecture in both directions.
      **•**	The architecture is complex as it follows MVVM models ie., Model View-ViewModel. 
      **•**	It is less scalable than React JS.
      **•**	It supports Bi-directional data binding which is two way data binding.
      **•**	It has regular DOM.  


**7. Is there any relation between Java and JavaScript?**
       
       No, they are entirely two different programming languages and have nothing to do with each other. But both of them are Object Oriented Programming languages and like many other languages, they follow similar syntax for basic features(if, else, for, switch, break, continue etc).          


**8. 1. How an HTTP Server Works:**

   **Client Sends a Request:**
         The process begins when a client (like a web browser) sends an HTTP request to the server. This request includes details like the method (GET, POST, etc.), the URL, headers, and sometimes a body (for POST requests).

   **Server Receives the Request:**
         The HTTP server listens on a specific port (usually port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS). When it receives a request, it processes the incoming data.

   **Server Processes the Request:**
         The server determines what action to take based on the request. For example, if a user requests a webpage, the server might retrieve the HTML file associated with that URL or generate content dynamically using a server-side language like Node.js, PHP, or Python.
   
   **Server Sends a Response:**
         After processing, the server sends an HTTP response back to the client. This response includes a status code (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found), headers, and a body (which could be an HTML page, JSON data, an image, etc.).

   **Client Receives the Response:**
         The client processes the response and displays the content to the user or handles the data accordingly.


**9. What is the fetch API?**
         
         The fetch API is a modern JavaScript interface that allows you to make network requests, such as retrieving data from a server or sending data to a server. It provides a more powerful and flexible way to work with HTTP requests and responses compared to older techniques like XMLHttpRequest.


**10. What is Authentication and Authorization?**
         
         Authentication and authorization are both important security processes that work together to keep applications, systems, and data safe: 
 
   **Authentication:**
         Verifies the identity of a user or device to ensure that only authorized users can access systems, services, and resources. 
 
   **Authorization:**
         Determines what actions, resources, or services a user is allowed to perform, based on their level of access.
